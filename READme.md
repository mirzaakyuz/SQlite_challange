# SQlite Challenge
## Chinook Database

In this challenge, the complex business questions 
are answered using structured query language.

The database used is chinook.db, which is a sample database 
available in several database systems. The Chinook data 
represents a digital media store containing information about 
artists, their albums,sales information about the albums & tracks 
as well as customers and employee 
information. A schema of the database is provided below.

Using the database, I have answered questions such as
how change the sales by country, what are the most popular 
genres, and how is the perfomance of each sales agent.
